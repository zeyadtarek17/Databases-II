# Databases-II
A small database engine with support for Octrees Indices. With the functionalities being 1) creating tables, 2) inserting tuples, 3) deleting tuples, 4) searching in tables linearly, 5) creating an Octree upon demand, and 6) using the created octree(s) where appropriate. We applied the concepts of database query optimization and indexing.
